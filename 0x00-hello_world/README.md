## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General:**

- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using `gcc`
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

**C:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

**Shell Scripts:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

## More Info

**Betty linter**

To run the Betty linter just with command `betty <filename>`:

1. Go to the Betty repository
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. `cd` into the Betty directory
4. Install the linter with `sudo ./install.sh`
5. `emacs` or `vi` a new file called betty, and copy the script below:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
   # and betty-doc separately on every item.
   # Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
   # Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)

   BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
   BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
   BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

   if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
       echo "No arguments passed."
       exit 1
   fi

   for argument in "$@" ; do
       echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
       ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
       ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
   done
* Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with `chmod a+x betty`
* Move the `betty` file into `/bin/` directory or somewhere else in your `$PATH` with `sudo mv betty /bin/`
* You can now type `betty <filename>` to run the Betty linter!

## Tasks

### 0. Preprocessor (mandatory)
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.
The output should be saved in the file `c`.

**GitHub repository:** `alx-low_level_programming`
**Directory:** `0x00-hello_world`
**File:** `0-preprocessor`

### 1. Compiler (mandatory)
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.
Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`.

**GitHub repository:** `alx-low_level_programming`
**Directory:** `0x00-hello_world`
**File:** `1-compiler`

### 2. Assembler (mandatory)
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`.

**GitHub repository:** `alx-low_level_programming`
**Directory:** `0x00-hello_world`
